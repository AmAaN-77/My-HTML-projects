<article><big><b>My Story:</b></big>Hi, my name is Amaan, and I’ve been passionate about becoming a software engineer since I was in 7th grade. From a young age, I was always curious about how apps, websites, and games work behind the scenes. That curiosity turned into a dream, and since then, I’ve been determined to turn that dream into reality.

Technology fascinates me, and I love learning how software can solve real-world problems. I’m constantly exploring programming languages, tech tools, and new innovations in the software world. My goal is not just to become a good coder, but a problem-solver who can build meaningful and impactful solutions.

I believe in learning from every challenge and growing step by step. For me, software engineering isn’t just a career choice — it’s a passion that drives me every single day.

Thank you!
